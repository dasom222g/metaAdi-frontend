  "main.why_description": "At the dawn of February 24, the daily life of Ukraine collapsed. War has erupted, starting with Russia's missile strikes on the Ukrainian capital Kiiu, and bombings have not stopped all over the country. Right now, Ukraine is attacking homes and roads, as well as kindergartens and hospitals, and as it attacks both civilians and soldiers, the casualties of civilians have exceeded 700 and the number of refugees has exceeded 1 million. We need a warm helping hand for the victims of the Ukrainian war who are going through a hellish day, and our Koreans who will be trembling in fear in a distant land away from their homeland. Please share your hopes so that we can escape the fear of war and return to a safe daily life as soon as possible.",
